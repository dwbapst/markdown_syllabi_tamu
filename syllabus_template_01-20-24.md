<!--
Here is just my example grade percentage table. Write your own!

|        |  
| -----  | ----------------
| **A**  | 90-100%
| **B**  | 80-89% 
| **C**  | 70-79%
| **D**  | 60-69%
| **F**  | Less than 60%


Note that my Markdown tables look much more neat than they have to look for them to look nice when formatted.

-->

Your final percentage for the course will be based on:

<!--

An example grade breakdown table.

|                               |     
| ----------------------------- | ----
| Some Assignments              | 40%
| Paper 1                       | 15%
| Other Assignments             | 10%
| In Class Presentations        | 10%
| Homework Assignments          | 25%


-->

<!--
 * Define a grading scale for the assignment of a letter grade (A through F) or the criteria for assigning S/U grades as appropriate.
 * Describe the graded items for the course. 
 * Indicate weights as applicable for grade items included in calculating the course grade (e.g., exams, laboratory assignments, field student work, projects, papers, homework, class attendance, participation, and other graded activities).

 **Graded Class Participation** – If class participation constitutes more than 10% of grade, the syllabus should explicitly define and outline how the participation grade is determined based on a well-defined rubric (see (Student Rule 10)[]). 

 **Graded Attendance** – If attendance is a graded item, the syllabus should state how the faculty member will collect and evaluate attendance. 

 **Grades for Stacked Course** – If the course is a stacked course that uses a single, combined syllabus for the undergraduate and graduate courses, the syllabus must clearly specify additional work required for graduate students. (See Policy for Stacked Courses.)

 **Grading Policy Changes** – Faculty must provide grading policies to students by the first class period. As such, faculty cannot change the course grading policy after the second class session. (See Student Rule 10.) 
--> 

<!--

It may be useful to have some subsections that explain details about each type of assignment.

### Some Assignments

Some text that explains what the assignments are.

-->


### Late Work Policy

Late work is ...?

<!--

 * Indicate whether or not the faculty member will accept late work. 

 * Identify any associated penalty if the faculty member accepts late work for evaluation. 

 The late work policy should define what constitutes late work (e.g., submitting a deliverable after the established deadline). Work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy. (See Student Rule 7.)

-->



### Course Schedule

<!--

Use a Markdown table for a calendar / course schedule you will stop fidgetting with the column widths of.

|              |     |          | Lecture Topic           | Assignments 
| ------------ | --- | -------- | ----------------------- | --------------------
| Week 1       | Tu  | Jan  16  | SNOW DAY                |
|              | Th  | Jan  17  | Course Introductions    | 
| Week 2       | Tu  | Jan  23  | A Lecture               |


 * Include a list of topics, calendar of activities, major assignment dates, and exam dates. 

 The course schedule must include lab hours in the calendar of activities. The course schedule must include dates of major exams and assignments. Dates for exams and assignments should not be changed without written notification to all students in the course (notice via email or learning management system is acceptable). 

 **Traditionally Delivered Course** – The calendar must include the number of weeks that correspond to the traditionally delivered course semester (e.g., Fall/Spring = 15 weeks; Summer = 5 or 10 weeks as appropriate).

 **Non-Traditionally Delivered Course** – The weeks on the calendar of activities for a non-traditional syllabus will vary according to need. Faculty members in departmental units will determine whether the contact hours for a non-traditional course are appropriate for and equivalent to a traditional course. Examples of non-traditional courses include: may-mester, winter-mester, fully online courses etc. (See University Rule 11.03.99.M1.)

If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work, should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case”* (Section 20.1.2.3, [Student Rule 20](https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules)).

With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an incident that meets the following conditions (see [University Rule 08.01.01.M1](https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf)):

Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention – including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University’s goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.
