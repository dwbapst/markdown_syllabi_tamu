<h3 id="special-course-designation">Special Course Designation</h3>
<p><strong>CORE CURRICULUM</strong> - This course fulfillls the Core Curriculum requirement for Life &amp; Physical Sciences. Courses in this category focus on describing, explaining, and predicting natural phenomena using the scientific method. Courses involve the understanding of interactions among natural phenomena and the implications of scientific principles on the physical world and on human experiences. The following skills will be addressed in the courses that comprise this area:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Thinking Skills</strong> – to include creative thinking, innovation, inquiry, and analysis, evaluation and synthesis of information. This will be taught through lecture mini assignments and online lab assignments, and assessed through those same assignments as well as major project assignments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication Skills</strong> – to include effective development, interpretation and expression of ideas through written, oral <em>and</em> visual communication. Students will experience working on their communication skills in their major projects, especially their group projects, which will also assess those same skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empirical and Quantitative Skills</strong> – to include the manipulation and analysis of numerical data or observable facts resulting in informed conclusions. This will be taught through the majority of lecture mini assignments and online lab assignments, which focus on analysis of numerical data and visual information, and assessed through those same assignments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teamwork</strong> – to include the ability to consider different points of view and to work effectively with others to support a shared purpose or goal. Students will have an opportunity to develop and reflect on their abilities to work with others as part of their two latter major projects, both of which are group work. A component of these assignments will be assessments on coordinating a plan for finishing their assigned work, assigning roles to each group member and providing feedback on their group members.</p></li>
</ul>
<!--
 Specify if the course has one (or more) of the following special course designations: core curriculum (CORE), international and cultural diversity (ICD), cultural discourse (CD), writing intensive (W), communication intensive (C), cross-listed, or stacked.

 Include other information as required for the special course designation (e.g., a W course syllabus must specify the student must pass the writing components to earn a grade in the course, a CORE course must include information about the foundational component area to which it belongs, a stacked course must clearly indicate additional work for graduate students, etc.).
-->
<h3 id="course-learning-outcomes">Course Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Students in Dinosaur World will learn to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Describe how the scientific method has led to our current understanding of dinosaurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the theory of natural selection to non-scientists.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the paleogeography and paleoclimate of the Mesozoic.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize major dinosaur groups and describe current hypotheses concerning their evolution and ecology.</p></li>
<li><p>Create and interpret phylogenetic trees depicting evolutionary relationships among dinosaurs and living archosaurs (birds and crocodilians).</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the geologic evidence for the cause of the Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction and evaluate the effect of this extinction on ecosystems.</p></li>
<li><p>Work collaboratively to plan and create works of oral, visual and written communication that express scientific information clearly for both well-informed parties and general audiences.</p></li>
<li><p>Critically evaluate non-specialist literature and media (television shows, videos, podcasts, web-sites) on dinosaurs and modern terrestrial ecology.</p></li>
</ol>
<!--
List one or more learning outcomes for the course.

A learning outcome is a statement regarding what the student will know or be able to do upon successfully completing the course. It must be both observable and measureable. The outcomes may include competencies developed in the course. Additional assistance with learning outcomes is available through the Center for Teaching Excellence and the Office of Institutional Assessment.

<p>Grades in this class will be based on the total grades of each of the component areas listed in the table above, with the percentage of your final grade determined by a component area as indicated.</p>
<h3 id="lecture-mini-assignments-associated-quizzes">Lecture Mini-Assignments &amp; Associated Quizzes</h3>
<p>In most weeks, there is a short assignment associated with the lecture content of the course. These assignments help build skills necessary for completing the laboratory assignments and reinforce key concepts covered in the lecture videos. In some cases, these assignments will require reading portions of the textbook. Quizzes that accompany these assignments serve to let you check your answers before submitting the assignment. You will have two attempts at the quiz and you highest quiz score will count. These assignments are often prerequisites to accessing that week’s laboratory.</p>
<h3 id="online-lab-assignments-associated-quizzes">Online Lab Assignments &amp; Associated Quizzes</h3>
<p>In most weeks, there are laboratory assignments posted to Canvas that are due by the following week. To access these assignments, you will need to complete the related lecture material and may also be required to submit the previous week’s laboratory assignment in some cases. Quizzes that accompany the laboratory assignments serve to let you check your answers before submitting the assignment. You will have two attempts at the quiz and you highest quiz score will count. These online laboratory assignments develop the use of quantitative data and measurements in testing hypotheses, visualizing patterns in data, and drawing synthetic conclusions. Thus, these lab exercises fulfill the visual communication, critical thinking, and quantitative analysis requirements of the core curriculum</p>
<h3 id="major-assignment-natural-selection-essay">Major Assignment: Natural Selection Essay</h3>
<p>To develop your written communication skills and apply the concept of natural selection to the evolution of the dinosaurs, you will write a short essay. A rubric will be used to grade this assignment and is provided on Canvas with a full description of the assignment. This fulfills the written communication requirement of the core curriculum.</p>
<h3 id="major-assignment-excavation-team-report">Major Assignment: Excavation Team Report</h3>
<p>After completing the four laboratory assignments associated with the excavation project, you will work with a team to arrive at a consensus regarding the identification of the organism(s), the paleoenvironment of the site, and paleoecology of the organisms.Together, the team will write a single consensus report. A rubric will be used to grade this assignment as is provided on Canvas with a full description of the assignment. This project fulfills the written communication requirements of the core curriculum, as well as the critical thinking, empirical analysis, and teamwork requirements.</p>
<h3 id="major-assginment-dinosaurs-in-the-media-team-video">Major Assginment: Dinosaurs in the Media Team Video</h3>
<p>For the final major project, you will work with your team to examine an example of how dinosaurs are depicted in the media and compare that to our modern idea of what dinosaurs are like and your knowledge from this class. The project will culminate in a scripted video presentation by your group. A rubric will be used to grade this assignment and is provided on Canvas with a full description of the assignment. This project fulfills the oral communication requirements of the core curriculum, as well as the critical thinking, empirical analysis and teamwork requirements.</p>
<!--
* Define a grading scale for the assignment of a letter grade (A through F) or the criteria for assigning S/U grades as appropriate.
* Describe the graded items for the course. 
* Indicate weights as applicable for grade items included in calculating the course grade (e.g., exams, laboratory assignments, field student work, projects, papers, homework, class attendance, participation, and other graded activities).

**Graded Class Participation** – If class participation constitutes more than 10% of grade, the syllabus should explicitly define and outline how the participation grade is determined based on a well-defined rubric (see (Student Rule 10)[]). 

**Graded Attendance** – If attendance is a graded item, the syllabus should state how the faculty member will collect and evaluate attendance. 

**Grades for Stacked Course** – If the course is a stacked course that uses a single, combined syllabus for the undergraduate and graduate courses, the syllabus must clearly specify additional work required for graduate students. (See Policy for Stacked Courses.)

**Grading Policy Changes** – Faculty must provide grading policies to students by the first class period. As such, faculty cannot change the course grading policy after the second class session. (See Student Rule 10.) 
-->
<h3 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>All assignments have a due date in Canvas. Meeting those due dates will ensure that you are pacing yourself appropriately to finish all assignments before the end of the course and that you have completed the work necessary to fully participate in the team assignments. While assignments on Canvas do not ‘close’ and you may submit assignments to meet module perquisites at anytime, work submitted more than two weeks after the Canvas due date will not be graded. No assignments will be accepted after the last day of the final exam period (<strong>May 7th</strong>). Work submitted late due to an excused absence is not considered late work, per Student Rule 07, and is exempt from the late work policy.</p>
<!--
* Indicate whether or not the faculty member will accept late work. 
* Identify any associated penalty if the faculty member accepts late work for evaluation. >

The late work policy should define what constitutes late work (e.g., submitting a deliverable after the established deadline). Work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy. (See Student Rule 7.)

<p>Texas A&amp;M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.</p>
<p>With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an incident that meets the following conditions (see <a href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf">University Rule 08.01.01.M1</a>):</p>

<li>The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention – including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post.

The University’s goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.</p>
