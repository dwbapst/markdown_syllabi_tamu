<p>Grades in this class will be based on a series of individual homework assignments, a final project with associated assignments, including in-class presentations and a final paper.</p>
<h4 id="term-project-drafts-and-final-project-paper">Term Project, Drafts and Final Project Paper</h4>
<p>This class requires a project-based term paper, with students proposing a project focused on research question of their own selection from within the earth and environmental sciences. Students are required to locate and obtain an appropriate dataset – perhaps from a publicly-available source, such as supplemental material for an article, or collected as part of their own research, or supplied by their advisor. <strong>Datasets must have a minimum of 10 samples and more than one variable measured for each sample, so that reasonable questions concerning multivariate data structure can be addressed.</strong> Addressing these research questions will require applying various analyses from throughout the course, and possibly beyond the covered course material.</p>
<p>During Week 3, students must submit a <strong>Project Proposal</strong>, where they briefly describe one or more potential research projects they might persue, and where they would get the data necessary, and the questions that would be addressed.</p>
<p>Drafts of the term paper are due at four points during the semester:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first draft due, the <strong>Introduction and Data Draft</strong>, is expected to contain (at a minimum) the introduction, and a partial Methods section that describes the context and background of the data: where, when, and <em>how</em> was the data collected, and also describing any necessary treatments required to further analyze the data.</p></li>
<li><p>The second draft, the <strong>Methods Draft</strong> is expected to build off the former draft, but also describe the analytical approaches the student will apply in the Methods section.</p></li>
<li><p>The third draft due should be a relatively complete <strong>Full Draft</strong>, adding results, discussion and any necessary figures or tables. We will review this and give you feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth is the <strong>Final Draft</strong>, which will be the basis for your final grade for the term paper.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the three interim drafts <strong>should have</strong> proper in-text citations and formatted references, include a file containing the current data set used for the project, regardless of whether it has been modified since the original data submission.</p>
<h4 id="project-associated-papers">Project-Associated Papers</h4>
<p>Several times during the semester, you will be asked to locate peer-reviewed literature related to your research project, and give a very brief introduction of the work to the rest of the class. This will happen at least twice: first, during the first month of the course, you will be asked to locate a peer-reviewed papers (an experimental study, topical review, etc) that is relevant to your current research project ideas, perhaps pertaining to the prior work in this area and/or the importance of future work on this area. The intent is that such a paper might then be a worthwhile source to eventually cite in the introduction section of your final research paper at the end of this class. In the later third of this class, after you have begun to cement an idea of what analytical methods you want to use in your class project, I’ll ask for a peer-reviewed study applies a similar methodological approach as what you are applying in your paper (and thus might again be a useful paper to publish in your final draft). Rather than submitting these papers via Canvas, I will ask you just to share a few sentences about this paper, as they may very well be useful to your fellow classmates as well.</p>
<h4 id="expected-structure-for-the-term-paper">Expected Structure for the Term Paper</h4>
<p>The length of your final paper will depends on how much you have to say to build an efficient, compelling investigation of your question. This final paper should be formatted like a scholarly manuscript, covering the methods, and results of their project. A complete paper draft will have the following required sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Abstract (REQUIRED)</strong> - A concise, one-paragraph summary of your study (e.g. questions, data, methods, results).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduction (REQUIRED)</strong> - Provide scientific context for your research question and background a reader would need to understand your study system and the importance of answering your research question. State your questions clearly and introduce how you will investigate them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods (REQUIRED)</strong> - A complete description of the data and analyses you use, with justifications for why you chose those specific methods. Include references that support your decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Results (REQUIRED)</strong> - A report of the results of your analyses, including reporting all necessary statistical values, and necessary supporting figures and tables. Interpretation of results should be minimized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion (REQUIRED)</strong> - An interpretation of your results in the context of the hypothesis you set out to test with reference to the published results of other workers. Address any analytical challenges, alternative interpretations, related your findings to the work of others, implications of your results to the field, and suggestions for future work that could improve your ability to answer your research questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusions (OPTIONAL)</strong> - A concise summary of the “take-home” results, interpretations, and implications of your research. Similar to the abstract, but does not restate the study’s setup.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>References (REQUIRED)</strong> - Choose a consistent journal format. If uncertain which to use, use Paleobiology style, as it the instructor’s favorite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Appendix (REQUIRED)</strong> - A file or table that contains all data you used for your paper. You must submit a data appendix with the draft of your Introduction and Methods draft, but you should update this appendix as you revise or add to your data over the course.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="project-presentations">Project Presentations</h4>
<p>Early in the semester, students will take turns introducing the rest of the class to the data and questions they are planning on addressing in the term project. This presentation does not require slides or graphics (although you can use them if you want), and should be less than 5 minutes in duration.</p>
<p>Later, students will again present to the class their project, covering again the questions motivating the research, the nature of the dataset, and which methods they are planning to apply, or have already applied, to the dataset. Students should particularly focus on any difficulties they’ve encountered, or confusion they have about which methods to apply. Again, slides or graphics are not necessary, and the presentation should be kept brief, preferably under 5-8 minutes.</p>
<p>In the last week of the course, students will be asked to prepare a more detailed presentation as an endcap to the research project for the semester. Slides, figures and any other graphic aids are recommended. Students are expect to re-introduce the rest of the class to the motivation behind their analyses, the data they used, the methods they applied and why they chose those methods, and what the results can tell us about in the context of the system. (Depending on the class size, time constraints and public health emergencies, the instructor may poll the student on whether live presentations are preferred over recorded presentations.)</p>
<p>For all the above presentations, students in the audience will actively participate by posing questions (for the live presentations), as well as providing written feedback about each other’s presentations, which will be passsed in an anonymized form to the presenter. Giving peer feedback, particularly on the final presentation, is a component of the Project Presentation grade.</p>
<!--
 * Define a grading scale for the assignment of a letter grade (A through F) or the criteria for assigning S/U grades as appropriate.
 * Describe the graded items for the course. 
 * Indicate weights as applicable for grade items included in calculating the course grade (e.g., exams, laboratory assignments, field student work, projects, papers, homework, class attendance, participation, and other graded activities).

 **Graded Class Participation** – If class participation constitutes more than 10% of grade, the syllabus should explicitly define and outline how the participation grade is determined based on a well-defined rubric (see (Student Rule 10)[]). 

 **Graded Attendance** – If attendance is a graded item, the syllabus should state how the faculty member will collect and evaluate attendance. 

 **Grades for Stacked Course** – If the course is a stacked course that uses a single, combined syllabus for the undergraduate and graduate courses, the syllabus must clearly specify additional work required for graduate students. (See Policy for Stacked Courses.)

 **Grading Policy Changes** – Faculty must provide grading policies to students by the first class period. As such, faculty cannot change the course grading policy after the second class session. (See Student Rule 10.) 
-->
<h3 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>Late work is discouraged, but will be accepted with a penalty relative to how late the submission is, depending on the assignment and reason given for the late submission. Work submitted late due to an excused absence is not considered late work, and is exempt from the late work policy.</p>
<!--
 * Indicate whether or not the faculty member will accept late work. 
 * Identify any associated penalty if the faculty member accepts late work for evaluation. 

 The late work policy should define what constitutes late work (e.g., submitting a deliverable after the established deadline). Work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy. (See Student Rule 7.)

<h3 id="title-ix-and-statement-on-limits-to-confidentiality">Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Texas A&amp;M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.</p>
<p>With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an incident that meets the following conditions (see <a href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf">University Rule 08.01.01.M1</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment.</li>
<li>The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention – including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University’s goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.</p>
<p>Students wishing to discuss concerns in a confidential setting are encouraged to make an appointment with <a href="https://caps.tamu.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> (CAPS).</p>

Title IX and Disability Resources have the ability to notify your instructors and provide rationale for excused absences when the situation warrants it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tell Somebody!</strong> - In many of these emergent situations, whether these are cases require prolonged absences or not, it is important to inform the university about situations involving many of the above scenarios, including mental health issues that might fall under SAS/UHS, and can be reported to the university via <a href="https://tellsomebody.tamu.edu/">the Tell Somebody webform</a>.</p></li>
